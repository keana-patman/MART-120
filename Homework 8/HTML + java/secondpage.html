    <h3 class="classOne"> Summary of a Sad Story</h3><br>
    <span>There was one point in my life where I actually read books. The one book that has made my cry the most was:<br>
    <br>
    <i>Where the Red Fern Grows</i> 
     By Wilson Rawls <br>
     <br>
     Here is a Summary of the book if you are interested.</span><br>
     <p class="classTwo">It is the story of Billy, a poor farm boy growing up in the Ozarks in Oklahoma,<br> 
        who works to buy and train two coonhound hunting dogs, Old Dan and Little Ann.<br>
      Together with his dogs, Billy becomes a champion coon hunter and they go on some fun and some tragic adventures together. <br>
      Sadly, one thing leads to another and Billy might have to leave the Ozarks to a place where the dogs won't be happy.<br>
      However, as fate has it, it's a sign from God that decides their futures.<br>
      Where the Red Fern Grows is a classic coming-of-age story.<br></p>
      <span>I would highly recommend the book.<br>
      <br>
      Now here is an image of a silly dog. </span><br>
